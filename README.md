#Automated Screen Shots saver

This is mini python project is aimed to reduce the time in taking individual screenshots.

Instead of pressing keys this allows to take automated screenshots in a duration only when there is a difference between the previous and current image.The image is then saved to a user specified directory.There is also an option for taking screenshots with reference to a time table in which screen shots are taken and stored in a directory having the subject name in a specified duration.

This mini-project is still in early stage.

Modules used:

Tkinter for GUI elements, pyAutoGui is used for capturing screen shot, SSIM algorithm from skimage is used for diffrentiating two images, open CV for processing the images, numpy for converting image to a numpyarry for processing, os for creating and processing the files.
